# AI-Powered Communication Assistant - Documentation

## 1. Problem Understanding
Modern organizations get hundreds of support-related emails every day. Manually sorting, prioritizing, and replying wastes time and reduces customer satisfaction.  
The goal of this project is to build an **AI-Powered Communication Assistant** that automates this process end-to-end.

## 2. High-Level Architecture
The solution is divided into **5 major components**:

1. **Email Retrieval Layer**  
   - Uses IMAP/Gmail/Outlook APIs to fetch incoming emails.  
   - Filters support-related emails using keywords like “Support”, “Query”, “Request”, “Help”.  

2. **Preprocessing & Information Extraction**  
   - Extracts metadata: sender, subject, timestamp.  
   - Extracts customer details: phone number, alternate email, product references, request.  
   - Cleans and formats the email body for ML processing.  

3. **AI Models & Categorization**  
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies each email as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.  
   - **Priority Detection**: Marks emails as Urgent or Not Urgent (based on keywords like “immediately”, “critical”).  
   - Implemented using Hugging Face models (BERT, DistilBERT) + keyword matching.  

4. **Response Generation**  
   - Uses **LLM (OpenAI GPT / Hugging Face T5)** with **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to create contextual replies.  
   - Draft replies are empathetic, professional, and reference specific details from the email.  
   - Urgent emails are processed first using a **priority queue**.  

5. **Dashboard & User Interface**  
   - Built with React frontend + Flask backend.  
   - Shows filtered emails with extracted details.  
   - Displays analytics:  
     - Total emails received in last 24 hrs  
     - Emails resolved vs pending  
     - Categories by sentiment and priority  
     - Interactive graphs  
   - Allows user to review/edit AI-generated responses before sending.

## 3. Workflow
1. Fetch emails → Filter by keywords  
2. Preprocess → Extract metadata and details  
3. Analyze → Sentiment + Priority  
4. Generate → AI draft response (context-aware)  
5. Display → Dashboard with analytics + editable responses  
6. User reviews → Approves or edits → Sends  

---

## 4. Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Frontend**: React + Chart libraries  
- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, simple)  
- **AI Models**: Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, T5) / OpenAI GPT APIs  
- **Email APIs**: IMAP/Gmail/Outlook Graph API

## 5. Why This Approach?
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort of sorting and drafting replies.  
- **Context Awareness**: AI uses customer details and sentiment for better replies.  
- **Scalability**: Works for small teams or enterprises.  
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Empathetic, fast responses improve retention.
